# .dockerignore

# This file tells Docker which files/directories to ignore when copying context during the image build process (via COPY or ADD commands in Dockerfile).

# CONTEXT: For devcontainers, this file is primarily useful if you're copying files into the image during build. Since our devcontainer mounts the workspace as a volume (not copying files), this file has minimal impact on our setup.

# However, it's still good practice to exclude build artifacts and dependencies that should be regenerated in the container environment.

# WHY THESE ENTRIES:
# - node_modules: Dependencies should be installed fresh in the container
# - .cache-deps: Docker volume containing node_modules and Deno cache
# - .next: Next.js build output should be regenerated
# - *.log: Log files are not needed in the image
# - deno.lock: Deno lockfile (will be regenerated)
# - .deno_cache: Deno cache directory
# - coverage: Test coverage reports are not needed in the image
